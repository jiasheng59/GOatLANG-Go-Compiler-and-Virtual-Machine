# GOatLANG: Go-Compiler-and-Virtual-Machine

## Instruction to build the system
We simplify the instruction to build the system to the following:
1. `git clone https://github.com/jiasheng59/GOatLANG-Go-Compiler-and-Virtual-Machine.git`
1. `cd GOatLANG-Go-Compiler-and-Virtual-Machine`
1. `mkdir build`
1. `cd build`
1. `cmake ..`
1. `make`
1. `./GOatLANG <testcase.goat>`

Please find the example test cases under `examples/`

Follow the following instructions if you wish to build the entire system from scratch.

1. Go to https://www.antlr.org/download.html. Download `antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.13.1-source.zip`. Unzip `antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.13.2-source.zip` and `cd` to the resulting directory `antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.13.2-source` Make sure you have all the required tools. Type the following commands in the terminal to install:
    - `sudo apt install cmake`
    - `sudo apt install uuid-dev`
    - `sudo apt install pkg-config`

1. Type the following commands:
    - `mkdir build && mkdir run && cd build`
    - `cmake ..`
    - `DESTDIR=../run make install`

1. Now copy the ANTLR 4 include files to `/usr/local/include` and the ANTLR 4 libraries to `/usr/local/lib` by entering the following commands (which assume that youâ€™re still in the `build` directory):
    - `cd ../run/usr/local/include`
    - `sudo cp -r antlr4-runtime /usr/local/include`
    - `cd ../lib`
    - `sudo cp * /usr/local/lib`
    - `sudo ldconfig`
